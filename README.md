# DyslexAid: Reading Assistant

A Chrome extension that makes any web page easier to read for people with
dyslexia, ADHD, low vision, or motion sensitivity. Click the toolbar icon and
flip on any mix of:

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Friendly font** | Swaps in [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org), whose weighted letter-bottoms resist flipping, and widens letter and word spacing |
| **Comfy spacing** | Raises line height, adds paragraph breathing room, and caps line length around 70 characters |
| **Bionic reading** | Bolds the first ~40% of every word so the eye anchors and glides. Works on infinite-scroll feeds too |
| **Reading ruler** | Puts a soft highlight band under your cursor so you never lose your line |
| **Warm tint** | Turns the background cream and adds gentle sepia to cut white-screen glare |
| **Calm mode** | Freezes animations, transitions, and motion on the page |
| **Text size** | Zooms the whole page from 100% to 160% |
| **Per-site pause** | Turns everything off for one site without losing your settings |

Keyboard shortcuts: **Alt+Shift+R** toggles the ruler, **Alt+Shift+B**
toggles bionic reading, and **Alt+Shift+S** starts or stops read aloud. All
three can be changed at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.

The popup is built so you do not have to know what any of this means before
you start. Four quick-start buttons (Dyslexia, Focus, Low vision, All off)
turn on a sensible bundle in one click, and the one that matches your
current toggles lights up. A preview sentence at the top changes as you flip
switches, so you can see the font, spacing, bolding, tint, and underlines
before you look at the page. Hover over or tab to anything and a panel in
the corner explains what it does and who it tends to help. A badge in the
header counts how many features are on.

The Settings button opens a page for the finer knobs: bionic boldness, tint
color (cream, blue, yellow, or green), ruler height, read-aloud speed, and
the list of paused sites.

Settings are saved with `chrome.storage.sync`, so they persist across pages,
restarts, and your other Chrome installs.

## Install (developer mode)

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this folder
4. Pin "DyslexAid" from the puzzle-piece menu and open any article

Try it on [demo/demo.html](demo/demo.html) (enable "Allow access to file URLs"
on the extension card, or just use any Wikipedia article).

## How it works

Settings live in one place: `chrome.storage.sync`. The popup and the
keyboard-shortcut service worker only write to it, and the content script in
every open tab listens for changes with `chrome.storage.onChanged` and applies
them. There is no custom message routing, and every tab stays in sync,
including tabs that were already open.

Each visual feature is a CSS attribute toggle. The content script flips an
attribute on `<html>` (for example `data-dyslexaid-font="on"`) and the
stylesheet rules keyed to that attribute do the actual restyling, so turning a
feature on or off costs a single DOM write.

Bionic reading is the one feature that rewrites the page. A `TreeWalker`
visits only text nodes, skips code blocks, form fields, and editable regions,
and wraps the start of each word in `<b class="dyslexaid-bionic">`. A
debounced `MutationObserver` catches content added after page load, which is
what makes the feature work on infinite-scroll feeds and comment sections.
When you toggle it off, the wrappers stay in the DOM and CSS renders them at
normal weight, so turning it back on is instant.

Read aloud uses the browser's built-in speech synthesis, so the audio is
generated on your machine and no text goes anywhere. It is also the one
place the extension uses a message instead of a setting. Reading aloud
happens once and is over, so there is nothing to store; the popup or the
shortcut sends `{type: "speak"}` to the active tab and the content script
speaks or stops. While speech runs, a large button sits in the corner of the
page so you can see it is on and stop it with a click.

The popup and settings page were built for the same readers as the
features. Every text and control color was measured against WCAG AA
(4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for controls), the toggles show a check mark so on and
off are not told apart by color alone, everything works by keyboard with
visible focus rings, the help panel is a live region so screen readers hear
it, switch animations turn off when your system asks for reduced motion,
and if you turn on the friendly font, the settings page uses it too. The
popup itself stays in the system font, because OpenDyslexic's wide letters
would push it past Chrome's 600px popup limit and force scrolling; the
preview card is where you see the font instead.

A few smaller details: the warm tint measures the page's background luminance
and leaves dark-themed pages alone, since sepia over near-black just looks muddy; every
popup control can be reached with Tab and toggled with Space, with visible
focus rings; and the extension asks for only three permissions (`storage`,
`activeTab`, and `scripting`).

## Known limits

The reading ruler and line focus follow the mouse only; there is no keyboard
control for them yet. Read aloud has no per-word highlighting. Both are on
the list.

## Privacy

DyslexAid collects nothing. It has no analytics and makes no network
requests; your settings are stored in Chrome's own sync storage and never
leave your browser.
